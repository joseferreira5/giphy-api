# giphy-api

GifTastic
For this homework assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a simple webisite that shows gifs. Whenever the user clicks on a topic botton, an ajax call is made to the GIPHY API, and it brings back 10 relevant gifs. The gifs are then displayed on the page. The user can add buttons with topics that they choose by entering it into the text form and clicking the submit button.

I have used Bootstrap for the grid and styling. I used jQuery to make the ajax call and event handling.
